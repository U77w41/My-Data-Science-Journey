# Assignment 5 Question:


1. create a numpy array of 1's  of 4x3x2 of type float16 

2. create a numpy array of 24 size numbers ranging from 3 to 4 in a linear space and reshape it 4x3x2 and column major fashion

2. add the two arrays and multiply by 2

3. truncate the numbers to integer type (int16)

4. reshape the result array to 6x4

5. create an identity matrix of shape 6x4 and subtract it from the array in 4

6. create an array of random integers of dimension 6x3 taking integers from 2 to 100

7. access every alternate element from row and column.

8. create an array of shape 4x3 with random numbers from poisson distribution

9. create an array by choose those numbers which are divisible by 2 or 5 (use boolean indexing) from the above array

10. create a 2D index array giving a random selection of index positions from the above array

10. create a suitable 2D array using the index array created above from the 1D array created in the step 9 (fancy indexing)

11. select the elements from the row index 1 and 3 and column index 1 from the 4x3 array created earlier (fancy indexing)

12. create an 1D array arr1 of 20 euqi-distant numbers from 2 to 20. Derive a new array arr2 of dimension 2x5x2 using reshape in a row major fashion. Now create a fresh array arr3 by reshape of the array arr2 to dimension 5x2x2 in column major fashion. Explain the placement of the numbers in arr3.

13. Take an image file (.jpeg file) and explore the usage of skimage module and image manipulation with numpy (for example usage refer to https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/user_guide.html).

14. Explore usage of json python module for reading and writing json files (https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html).
