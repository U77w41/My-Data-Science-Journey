# Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Investments

## ABOUT THE COURSE:
### Over the next few decades, machine-learning (ML) and AI will transform not only the finance industry but also other industries that borrow significantly from finance. This program has been carefully designed to help future analysts, traders, brokers, consultants and other industry professionals who are either currently exposed to, or foresee artificial intelligence, machine-learning and data science proliferate their work environment. The operating environment for investment management firms continues to evolve, with technological innovations and shifting investor preferences at the heart of this change. In that context, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is providing new opportunities to both professionals and investors. The objective of this course is to understand the application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques in financial markets, trading, and asset management. This program aims to demonstrate the applications of AI-based models in the finance domain. This includes solving real-life wealth management problems to improve investment decisions with AI.
