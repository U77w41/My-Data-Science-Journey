The field of Big Data Analytics lies at the intersection of statistics, mathematics, computer science and engineering. In recent years, development of sophisticated learning algorithms coupled with the availability of massive datasets and facilitated by powerful and efficient computing infrastructures, have led to pioneering improvements in the field of analytical applications.


RKMVERI offers a two year (four semester) MSc degree programme in Big Data Analytics. The curriculum encompasses topics from  Mathematics, Statistics, Economics and Computer Science and Engineering.


This two year degree programme equips the student with the skill to assimilate, manage, analyse and interpret large datasets.. They will also learn business functions and analytics in various domains from Finance to Retail to Pharma, etc. During the fourth semester the students undertake the MSc degree project, which can either be a research project or a full time internship programme at a reputed organization.


This MSc degree programme is designed in collaboration with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), under its whole new long term initiative called Academia Interface Programme.
